    There is an urgent need to modernize Custom Quality Messenger (CQ) at both the infrastructure and application levels. A top priority is to migrate away from the Oracle Application Server. We will begin this modernization effort with CQ’s Order Builder.
    
    Additionally, we are considering the future of CQ and its integration with the new, yet-to-be-defined Manufacturing Execution System (MES). If the MES provides global tracking capabilities, this will be important to consider.
    
    We chose to start with CQ’s Order Builder because, regardless of the MES’s final design, CQ must continue to operate alongside any new system until it is fully capable of taking over its functions.
